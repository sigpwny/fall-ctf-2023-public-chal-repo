**beware: 32-bit signed integer overflow**

Things to keep in mind
- there is a function to do factorial and combination
- these functions are slow (since they are recursive)
- you can speed them up to make them faster to run
- integer overflow makes the calculations not mathematically correct
- reverse the factorial function first, then the combination
