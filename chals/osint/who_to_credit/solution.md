# Solution

This challenge is solved by viewing the EXIF data of the given file, specifically the "Author" field. 

You can install `exiftool` on Linux, and then run `exiftool flowers.jpeg` to view all EXIF fields. Alternatively, some GUI image viewers will display EXIF data beside the image or in a Details... menu.
