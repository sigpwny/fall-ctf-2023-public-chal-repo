# Squirrel for Hire Solution

This challenge involves finding Pinto Bean's LinkedIn, which is linked from Instagram, and then taking a close look at his profile page to find the flag.

On LinkedIn, like most social media sites, profile pictures are cropped into a circular shape with CSS. But the whole, square/rectangular profile picture is sent to your web browser. A user can right-click on a PFP and open it in a new tab, exposing the whole image. Pinto Bean's PFP is modified to have a piece of the flag hidden in each corner, so that opening it in a new tab reveals the flag!
