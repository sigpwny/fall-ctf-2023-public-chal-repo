# Distinguished Editor Solution

In this challenge, we have to track down a Wikipedia editor who has interacted with Pinto Bean's Wikipedia page. You can interact with a page by editing it, but also by leaving a comment on the Talk page. The newest comment at the time of the CTF was by a user named Pintopintobean. Going to Pinto's profile page yields the flag.
