# Import necessary functions and modules
# 'secrets' is used to generate random cryptographic keys
# 'token_bytes' generates random bytes, and 'itertools.cycle' is used to repeat the key if it's shorter than the data
from secrets import token_bytes
from itertools import cycle

# Define a function 'XOR' that takes two byte sequences and applies bitwise XOR operation on them element-wise
XOR = lambda a, b: bytes([i ^ j for i, j in zip(a, cycle(b))])

# Open and read the contents of a file named "flag.png" in binary mode ('rb')
flag = open("flag.png", "rb").read()

# Generate a random cryptographic key of 8 bytes using 'token_bytes'
key = token_bytes(8)

# Encrypt the 'flag' (image data) using the XOR operation with the 'key'
ciphertext = XOR(flag, key)

# Open a new file named "cipher.bin" in binary write mode ('wb')
cipher_file = open("cipher.bin", "wb")

# Write the encrypted data (ciphertext) to the "cipher.bin" file
cipher_file.write(ciphertext)

# The code essentially reads an image file ("flag.png"), generates a random cryptographic key,
# encrypts the image using XOR, and then saves the encrypted data to a new file ("cipher.bin").
