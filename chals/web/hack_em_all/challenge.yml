  I found this cool site that lets me show an admin my name ideas.
  Maybe the admin has some special information on their page.

hints:
  - An admin will view the page when we send the name, can we exploit that?
  - Try `<i>your name</i>`, does it look different? Maybe we can do something like this but with Javascript?
  - Make sure to wait for the page to load before sending the body
